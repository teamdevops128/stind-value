As part of our disaster management strategy, Iâ€™d like to suggest that we consider using GitLab and Azure Repos as our version control solutions. Both platforms provide robust features to help ensure our code remains secure and accessible, even in the event of unforeseen disruptions.
GitLab offers flexible repository management, and their disaster recovery features include automated backups and the ability to access the repository from anywhere. With the free tier, we can host up to 10 GB per repository and 5 GB total storage


Pricing (Azure Repos Basic Plan): Free for up to 5 users.
